# # Jupyter Notebook
#
# Jupyter notebook, formerly known as the IPython notebook, is a flexible tool that helps you create readable analyses, as you can keep code, images, comments, formulae and plots together.
#
# Jupyter is quite extensible, supports many programming languages and is easily hosted on your computer or on almost any server â€” you only need to have ssh or http access. Best of all, it's completely free.
#
# The name Jupyter is an indirect acronyum of the three core languages it was designed for: **JU**lia, **PYT**hon, and **R**

# ## Keyboard Shortcuts
#
# - To access keyboard shortcuts, use the command palette: `Cmd + Shift + P`
#
# - `Esc` will take you into command mode where you can navigate around your notebook with arrow keys.
# - While in command mode:
#    - A to insert a new cell above the current cell, B to insert a new cell below.
#    - M to change the current cell to Markdown, Y to change it back to code
#    - D + D (press the key twice) to delete the current cell
#
